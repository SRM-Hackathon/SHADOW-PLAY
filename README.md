# SHADOW-PLAY
When A User enters a personal identification number(PIN) as a numeric password in mobile or stationary systems, including smart phones, tablet computers, automated teller machines (ATM), and point of sale (PoS) terminals, a direct observation attack based on shoulder surfing becomes great concern.



The PIN entry can be observed by nearby adversaries, more effectively in a crowded place.


Since the same PIN is usually chosen by a user for various purposes and used repeatedly, a compromise of the PIN may cause the user a great risk.
