# SHADOW-PLAY
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
When A User enters a personal identification number(PIN) as a numeric password in mobile or stationary systems, including smart phones, tablet computers, automated teller machines (ATM), and point of sale (PoS) terminals, a direct observation attack based on shoulder surfing becomes great concern.



The PIN entry can be observed by nearby adversaries, more effectively in a crowded place.


Since the same PIN is usually chosen by a user for various purposes and used repeatedly, a compromise of the PIN may cause the user a great risk.


Strategy that will completely neglect Shoulder Surfing even a Well Trained Perceptual Grouper could not Crack the PIN Digit Entered by the User in a Conventional Way using four colour method .

## FUTURE SCOPE & ENHACEMENTS
      
      1) Full flexed independent  INTRUDER PIN PREVENTION SERVICE can be built and hosted as an independent service  authentication              service that be consumed by any other external business domain system  by calling the API interface.
      
      2) Further Innovation can be applied from the user usability aspect to reduce the no of turns.
      
      
## PROJECT OUTCOME
            
      We believe implementing “INTRUDER PIN PREVENTION USING colour METHOD” at Banking, ATMs, POS Terminals, etc., will significantly         strengthen the security of the system by putting an end to shoulder surfing issues.
